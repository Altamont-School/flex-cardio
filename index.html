      <h1>üî• Welcome to Flex Cardio! üî•</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! This is meant as a quick workout to *flex* on those Flex skills
        üòù For this lesson, you can see the way the solutions are supposed to
        render by visiting this page. <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/4dcb29f6-bfbf-4eb2-8d5b-d8a3602c1cb1" target="_blank">I've also got a video</a> (<a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/b8ac4a32-c599-46d6-b947-ff4b87fc239e" target="_blank">with a follow up here</a>)that walks you
        through each. How should you tackle this? Great question!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, figure out what works best for you: either having me walk
          through things with you <i>or</i> trying it yourself and using the
          video as backup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, start working from top to bottom...these are designed to
          increase with difficulty as you move through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, document your solutions in OneNote. The goal here is to be
          reflective and understand <i>how</i> your solutions work.

    <h2 class="problem-title">Problem #1</h2>
    <p class="instructions">
      This is a really common pattern with flexbox. We want to take multiple
      pieces of content and align them vertically. A complete solution will
      include a margin between Homer's circular image and the text.
      Additionally, both elements will be vertically aligned on the center of
      the axis as shown in the solution.

      Concerning Hobbitses...Frodo, Sam, and Pippin need some styling to make
      sure they're evenly spaced within this container. A couple of hints to
      help you with this one: images aren't set to specific widths; instead,
      they need to be a certain percentage of their parent container. How wide?
      You'll have to play around and find out!

      Undoubtedly the most challening of them all. If you can complete this
      problem on your own, I'll consider you a Flex Master and ready to move
      onto grid. Like the Ron Swanson example, you'll need to work with nested
      elements (i.e., multiple flex containers) to get this one pixel-perfect.
